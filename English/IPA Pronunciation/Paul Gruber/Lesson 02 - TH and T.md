#Lesson-02-TH-and-T #TH-and-T
## TH - unvoiced and TH voiced
To produce the TH sound correctly, you need to first stick your tough out between your teeth and bite down slightly, then blow. This create air friction. The sound comes from air friction should be very loud. Keep your tough flat and maintain min a steady flow air. Not stick your tough out a little bit, I am saying stick it way out at least while you practicing to get used to the feeling. The TH sound comes from the air and the friction.
## Practice with TH
