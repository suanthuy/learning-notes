#S-and-Z-practice
Another **z**ippy, **z**appy, cra**z**y day come**s** to a clo**s**e. **As** we **z**oom up to Joe'_s_ snoo**z**e **z**one, **z**oe _JoneS_ of **z**odiac **z**oo play**s** with her *z*ipper. Last week, Jim'_s_ brother*s* were picked to represent their country in the Olympic Game*s*. Two of the brother*s* were swimmer**s**, while the other two were long distance runner**s**.  All of the brother**s** wore glasse**s**. The**s**e athletes worked hard at qualifying for the game**s** and were hoping to come home with pri**z**e**s**. Since the brother**s** go to the same university, they often take the same course**s**. This makes studying ea**s**ier and give**s** them more time to do other thing**s**. 
On thur**s**day, I had a very la**z**y day. I woke up early, and first squee**z**ed orange**s** into juice. I then got dressed, and watched the sunri**s**e come up over the mountain**s**. It wa**s** so beautiful that I took many picture**s** with my camera and I u**s**ed three roll**s** of film. After drinking two cups of coffee, I got dressed, left the house, and walked three mile**s** home.
