00:11:24.959 give specific reasons and examples to
00:11:27.480 support your preference
00:11:29.880 begin preparing now
00:12:01.800 foreign
00:12:03.260 speaking now
00:12:05.760 personally I would rather get news
00:12:09.120 online than read it in a newspaper for
00:12:13.079 starters it's more convenient in many
00:12:15.839 ways for example I can read all the word
00:12:19.200 next new papers from anywhere via my
00:12:23.519 laptop or mobile phone so I don't even
00:12:27.000 have to go out to the store to buy them
00:12:29.820 moreover mostly is free to read online
00:12:33.720 the other thing is that news websites
00:12:36.839 are more current than papers
00:12:39.560 newspaper only give an update on a
00:12:42.600 situation at the time of printing
00:12:44.899 whereas online news is totally up to the
00:12:49.079 minute therefore you can get the latest
00:12:52.019 news without waiting that is why I think
00:12:55.740 it's better to catch up with current
00:12:57.899 events to online news instead of a
00:13:01.200 newspaper
00:13:03.839 foreign
