00:04:00.080 speaking now
00:04:02.099 this picture was taken in a classroom
00:04:04.799 some people who seem to be students are
00:04:07.920 in a group discussing something a woman
00:04:10.439 on the right is holding a red photo and
00:04:13.319 gesturing I think she's giving a lecture
00:04:16.560 or an explanation to the class next to
00:04:19.978 her a man in a blue sweater is folding
00:04:23.280 his arms and looking at the lecture the
00:04:27.000 rest of the students are also looking at
00:04:29.340 her and listening carefully
00:04:31.740 foreign
00:04:33.660 begin preparing now
00:05:21.419 begin speaking now
00:05:23.699 this is a picture of a food vendor
00:05:26.580 preparing a meal on the left a man in a
00:05:29.759 red jacket seems to be buying some bread
00:05:32.220 there are two people on the right side
00:05:34.919 of the picture one is pointing at the
00:05:37.860 bender and the other is carrying
00:05:40.199 something on his shoulder two motorbikes
00:05:43.080 are parked in front of the shop I can
00:05:46.199 see a few men passing by in the back the
00:05:49.199 people look busy so I guess this picture
00:05:51.479 was taken in the morning
00:05:53.720 in this part of the test you will answer
00:05:56.340 three questions
00:05:58.080 for each question you will have three
00:06:00.180 seconds to prepare
00:06:01.860 you will have 15 seconds to respond to
00:06:04.380 question 5 and 6 and 30 seconds to
00:06:06.840 respond to question seven imagine that
00:06:09.360 an American marketing firm is doing
00:06:10.979 research in your country
00:06:13.020 you have agreed to participate in a
00:06:15.060 telephone interview about dining out
00:06:17.759 when was the last time you ate out
00:06:20.280 begin preparing now
00:06:26.280 begin speaking now
00:06:28.560 well I ate out at a Chinese restaurant
00:06:31.919 with my parents last Sunday we had
00:06:35.100 noodles with black bean salt and sweet
00:06:37.740 and sour pork which is the most popular
00:06:40.380 Chinese food in Vietnam
00:06:45.720 what's your favorite restaurant and why
00:06:48.960 begin preparing now
00:06:55.080 begin speaking now
00:06:57.180 actually the Western I like the best is
00:07:00.180 a little Japanese place downtown that
00:07:03.060 specialize in raw fish and Sushi I like
00:07:07.259 that place because it is fresh
00:07:10.020 ingredients and its prices are
00:07:12.660 reasonable
00:07:14.400 what factors influence decision when you
00:07:16.860 choose a restaurant
00:07:18.539 begin preparing now
00:07:24.780 begin speaking now
00:07:26.539 while the two main factors I consider
00:07:29.940 when choosing a restaurant are
00:07:32.099 healthiness and cost First I don't eat a
00:07:36.120 restaurant that is a lot of artificial
00:07:38.940 seasonings or too much salt as is very
00:07:42.599 unhealthy furthermore I hate spending
00:07:45.660 too much money when dining out because I
00:07:48.660 have a tight budget therefore I think
00:07:51.539 it's important to check whether the
00:07:54.000 restaurant serves healthy food at a
00:07:56.280 reasonable price
00:07:58.500 in this part of the test you will answer

00:11:09.000 you will have 30 seconds to prepare
00:11:11.820 then you will have 60 seconds to speak
00:11:14.180 what do you think about this statement
00:11:16.320 an employee's performance appraisal
00:11:18.240 should be based on the manager's
00:11:19.740 evaluation
00:11:21.180 give your opinion and use specific
00:11:22.980 reasons to support it
00:11:27.240 begin preparing now
00:11:59.519 thank you begin speaking now
00:12:03.480 well I agree that an employee's
00:12:06.360 performance appraisal should be based
00:12:09.180 many of the managers evaluation the main
00:12:12.660 reason is that the manager is in the
00:12:15.240 best position to assess a worker
00:12:17.880 performance I mean managers aside and
00:12:21.300 monitor employees work directly
00:12:23.480 therefore they know how quickly and
00:12:26.100 effectively employees perform tasks in
00:12:29.399 addition managers are the best people to
00:12:32.459 give the detailed and constructive
00:12:34.680 feedback to employees performance
00:12:37.560 appraisals should also aim to improve
00:12:40.200 employees skills and considering
00:12:42.839 managers managers of work experience
00:12:45.600 they are able to provide workers with
00:12:48.600 informative feedback for these reasons I
00:12:52.139 think it's a great idea to allow
00:12:54.240 managers to evaluate their employees
00:12:56.880 performance
00:13:00.480 foreign
