00:06:13.860 your credit card
00:06:15.840 how many credit cards do you have and
00:06:17.820 how often do you use them begin
00:06:19.979 preparing now
00:06:25.500 begin speaking now
00:06:28.259 I only have one card and I think I use
00:06:31.020 it nearly every day I use it quite often
00:06:34.440 because I don't like to carry lots of
00:06:36.720 cash also it's very useful when I'm
00:06:39.600 running out of cash
00:06:44.340 what do you use your credit card for
00:06:47.759 again preparing now
00:06:53.759 begin speaking now
00:06:56.160 well of course I use it to pay for items
00:06:59.280 I buy at stores or on the internet I
00:07:02.819 also use it to buy food every day so my
00:07:06.240 credit card is absolutely necessary in
00:07:09.000 my daily life
00:07:10.380 foreign
00:07:13.639 how could your credit card service be
00:07:15.960 improved
00:07:17.160 begin preparing now
00:07:22.919 begin speaking now
00:07:25.199 well I think the security of credit
00:07:27.479 cards should be improved the reason is
00:07:30.479 that if it's stolen it can be used by
00:07:33.720 strangers and cause a big problem for
00:07:36.539 the owner for example I have a friend
00:07:39.780 who's
00:07:41.060 was host credit card was stolen recently
00:07:44.460 and it was used to buy thousands of
00:07:48.180 dollars worth of stuff therefore I
00:07:51.360 definitely wish that credit cards were
00:07:55.020 safer

00:11:06.420 time allowed
00:11:07.680 you will have 30 seconds to prepare
00:11:10.500 then you will have 60 seconds to speak
00:11:12.720 do you agree or disagree with the
00:11:14.880 following statement it's a great idea
00:11:16.860 for University students to work
00:11:18.600 part-time to get prepared for the
00:11:20.279 business world
00:11:21.660 include specific reasons and examples to
00:11:24.480 support your opinion
00:11:25.980 begin preparing now
00:11:59.339 begin speaking now
00:12:01.980 well I agree with the idea that
00:12:05.220 University students out to work
00:12:07.260 part-time to get prepared for the
00:12:09.600 business world the main reason is that
00:12:12.120 working part-time teaches students
00:12:14.760 important skills they will need in the
00:12:17.279 future
00:12:18.180 for example they can discover how to
00:12:21.540 cooperate with their co-workers finish
00:12:25.079 tasks on time deal with customers and so
00:12:29.399 on
00:12:30.300 the other reason is that working
00:12:32.519 part-time jobs help students plan their
00:12:36.240 future career
00:12:37.920 what I mean is through work experience
00:12:40.620 they can discover what sorts of work
00:12:43.620 they like or dislike as well as what
00:12:47.339 they're good at
00:12:48.779 therefore I think it's a great idea for
00:12:51.720 students to have various change chances
00:12:55.139 to work part-time
